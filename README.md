# aws-data-mining

## Files Structure

The main datamining codes are in two files: One is named **"pyspark.ipynb"** which uses the pyspark as the data mining approach.
The other one is named **"pandas-sklearn.ipynb"** which combines pandas with sklearn to realize the whole data mining.

Both two approaches will be discussed in my report in order to obtain the more detail analysis.

## Dataset

Since my dataset, namely "SBAnational.csv" whose size is 179.4 MB is too large to push to github directly. I have asked Mina about it and got a permittion to upload it seperately. 
You can get my dataset by click this link https://drive.google.com/file/d/11rmNIzAC-ZMXAmmWFS_ExZdxCCx9JmKo/view?usp=sharing and download from google drive.
If you have any problems,you can contact me through my email xjin627@aucklanduni.ac.nz. 

Thanks a lot! : )
